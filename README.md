# Google Data Analytics Course Certificates Caption Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the project work for the Google Data Analytics Course Certificates Caption Project. The project involves analyzing bike trip datasets and generating insightful captions and visualizations to present the findings.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:

- Analyze bike trip datasets provided as part of the Google Data Analytics Course.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
- Explore and visualize key trends and insights from the bike trip data.
- Generate informative captions to accompany visualizations.
- Create a comprehensive project report summarizing our findings.

## Dataset

The bike trip datasets used for this project are provided as part of the Google Data Analytics Course. These datasets include information about bike trips, such as start and end times, trip durations, user information, and more.

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with the analysis code.
- `reports/`: Project reports summarizing the analysis and insights.
- `visualizations/`: Visualizations generated from the analysis.

## Notebooks 
- the first notebook contains code for loading the csv datasets for each month of 2021
- the second notebook contains code for cleaning and for processing the dataset
- the third notebooks contains codes for analysing the data

## Visualizations
_ the visualization was done using Power BI
_ i analyses the data in 3 different sheets where i created dashborad to visualize bike trips for 3 different categories 
_ The notebooks contains details about the projects
